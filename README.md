#### JavaScript 3D library ####

"The aim of the project is to create an easy to use, lightweight, cross-browser, general purpose 3D library. The current builds only include a WebGL renderer but WebGPU (experimental), SVG and CSS3D renderers are also available in the examples."

### FUI ###

Fictional user interfaces : "genuinely influential in the real world because when new technology does catch up (which is happening really fast right now) FUI designers have already mapped out the territory and UI designers invariably use those reference points."
